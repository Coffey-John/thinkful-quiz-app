1. There is a safe house but you have to cross a long street with hundreds of zombies on it, what's the best course of action?
-Try to sneak past the zombies and only kill the ones that see you
-Hot wire a car and plow through them to get to the other side
-Run straight through them with your weapon and hope you get to the other side in time
-Take out the zombies one by one being as stealthy as possible

2. What is the safest place to stay during the apocalypse?
-In my house. I already have a food stash and weapons to protect myself with.
-Inside a grocery store or mall, which will have unlimited supplies and weapons to sustain myself.
-At the police station. More weapons than anywhere else as well as people who know how to fight.
-A hospital, they might have a cure to the zombie virus!

3. You are about to escape the zombie infected city, but the military starts to bomb it to quarantine it, what do you do?
-Hunker down and stay in the city to fend for yourself
-Try to swim across the 1 mile river to safety
-Try to run across the bridge before it's completely destroyed
-Send out an SOS flare to try to get them to stop the bombing

4. You're being chased by a horde of zombies and you are about to enter the safe room, but realize one of the zombies chasing you is your friend. What do you do?
-Try to take him into the safe room with you while you look for a possible cure.
-Lock yourself in the safe room, there's no reasoning with him and he might infect you as well.
-Try to take out the rest of the zombies to save your friend
-Hug your friend and try to get him to snap out of it so he can tell the rest of the zombies to leave you alone!

5. You're on your way to a rescue zone but your car runs out of gas. The next gas station is 7 miles and the rescue zone is 50 miles away. What do you do?
-Walk 7 miles to the gas station on foot to get gas and then go back to fill your car
-Resolve to run the remaining 50 miles (2 marathons) and not stop until you make it to the rescue zone
-Try to hot wire another car without setting off its alarm
-Stay in your car
-Head back to the closest city and come up with another plan
